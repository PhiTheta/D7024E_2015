# D7024E_2015 [![Build Status](http://luxxorina.luxxor.se:9980/buildStatus/icon?job=D7024E-Distributedsomething)](http://luxxorina.luxxor.se:8888/job/D7024E-Distributedsomething)


####Objectives:
- [ ] In the joinRing() method. the join should use fingerlookup to know which place the node should be added.

### Objective 2:
- [ ] In the joinRing() method. the join should use fingerlookup to know which place the node should be added.

### Objective 3:
- [ ] Data replication between nodes
- [ ] DHT (Distributed Hash Table) between Node, predecessor and successor. This hashtable contains the key and location(value) of the files/data inside of the node.
- [ ] Kill post to the API which stops the node. (It can come back online after some time)

### Objective 4:
- [ ] Tests to show functionality of the web service (Use POSTMAN)
- [ ] Update the API so it correctly updates the DHT with Key - Location(value) and creates the file with the data.

### Objective 5:
- [ ] Create using docker container/image.
- [ ] Get the docker to run

### Project Report:
- [ ] Update for each Objective

This is our directory for the laboration in the course D7024E @ Lule√• University of Technology

The workflow/planning will be logged in the wiki. Each objective has their own milestone (and wiki page)
Each issue which is labeled "Task" is connected to a milestone. These are the tasks that are needed to be implemented and finished.

On the Wiki there are also be worklogs.
